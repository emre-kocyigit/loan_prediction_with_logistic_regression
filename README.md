# loan_prediction_with_logistic_regression

I use "loan.csv" file as a dataset. The source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/simple-loan-classification-dataset/data

You will see a few EDA and preprocessing steps which are important for ML models. The data is too good to be good -> Toy data. Therefore, scores are perfect! Nevertheless, the approach is still applicable for other datasets and problems. Be careful about data leakage!
